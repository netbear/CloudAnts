Release 0.81 on 6/15/2010

Changes made since 0.80.2:

* IMPORTANT: we have upgraded the Hadoop Core jar to v0.20.2. Since
  this version of Hadoop requires Java 6, in order to retain backwards
  compatibility with Java 5, you will need to replace this jar with
  the Hadoop 0.18.* core jar.
* Multiple donors for Voldemort Rebalancing: speeds up rebalancing, by
  allowing a single stealer node to transfer partitions from multiple
  nodes
* Features for EC2 Testing
* Read-only Stores: backwards compatibility with 0.70, bug fix in
  Checksum code
* Hadoop InputFormat, Pig LoadFunc in Contrib: ability to perform
  Map/Reduce (either directly via Hadoop or using Pig) over data in
  Voldemort stores. See: 
  < contrib/hadoop/test/voldemort/hadoop/VoldemortWordCount.java > for
  an example.
* Voldemort Performance Tool: performance measurement tool based on
  YCSB (Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark) code. Run
  < bin/voldemort-performance-tool.sh --help > for more information.
* Reverted default failure detector implementation back to
  BannagedPeriodFailureDetector due to potential bugs in the
  ThresholdFailureDetector

Release 0.80.2 on 4/27/2010

Changes made since 0.80.1:

* Batched NIO writes (improves performance for AdminClient/Streaming 
  operations when the NIO connector is enabled)
* VoldemortAdminTool: Added support to specify stores, support to
  fetch all keys to a binary file, support to save keys in ASCII
  (JSON) format [experimental], capability to add stores. Run
  < bin/voldemort-admin-tool.sh --help > for more information.
* Minor bug fixes for Rebalancing
* Issue 240: Voldemort fetcher should use different temp directories for
  different stores
* Checksum capability during construction of Voldemort read-only stores

Release 0.80.1 on 3/23/2010

Changes made since 0.80:

* Issue 133: Support for Apache Avro as a serialization format
* Issue 223: Changed the default client to use
  TresholdFailureDetector
* Fixed issue 222: Revised KeyedResourcePool.close(K key) to fix
  leaking sockets
* Fixed issue 198: Revised ReadRepairer to use a separate copy of the
  vector clock, fixing a situation where NoSuchElementException would
  be thrown
* Miscellaneous enhancement: support for TCP keep-alives, improved
  read only store utilities, command line interface to AdminClient,
  improved load testing tools

Release 0.80 on 2/18/2010

Changes made since 0.70.1:

* IMPORTANT: backwards compatibility between the client and server has
  changed. A backwards incompatibility in the wire protocol was found
  between releases 0.60 to 0.70.1 and releases prior to 0.60. We chose
  to make 0.80 compatible with 0.57.1 and earlier versions, while
  introducing an incompatibility with 0.60-0.70.1. What this means is
  that if you're presently running 0.60 and higher, you would need to
  upgrade the Voldemort jar files on *all* servers and clients.
* Upgraded the BDB storage engine to use BerkeleyDB-JE 4.0.92,
  retaining ability to use BerkeleyDB-JE 3.3.* if desired. IMPORTANT:
  if one switches from BerkeleyDB-JE 3.3.* to 4.0.92 they will be able
  to access all of existing data. Once a switch has been made to
  4.0.92 the data will not be readable by earlier versions of BDB. If
  there's a chance that a roll back to 3.3.* might be needed, the best
  course of action will be to make a backup of existing data
  prior to upgrading.
  Switching between 3.3.* and 4.0.* would also require rebuilding the
  class files (e.g., by running "ant clean && ant release" after
  replacing the BDB jar files).
* Compression support for read-only stores
* Increased the socket buffer size for transferring read-only
  stores from Hadoop for improved performance over high-latency links
* NIO support for the Admin Service, including Streaming
  Functionality
* Support for adding stores on the fly via the Admin
  Service
* Fixed issue 209: Incorrect object passed to List.contains in 
  RebalanceUtils.getLatestCluster()
* Fixed issue 211: Unnecessary read repairs during getAll() with more
  than one key
* Other enhancements: better CLI for rebalancing, throttling in
  Admin Service is now based on all disk activity

Release 0.70.1 on 2/1/2010

Changes made since 0.70:

* Fixed issue 205: if no keys passed to getAll() were in partitions
  undergoing rebalancing, proxyGetAll() would be called with an
  empty list even if rebalancing wasn't happening

Release 0.70 on 1/27/2010

Changes made since 0.60.1:

* A beta of rebalancing (dynamic cluster expansion) support merged
  into the main branch. See the project's wiki for more information:
  http://wiki.github.com/voldemort/voldemort/voldemort-rebalancing
* New failure detector merged into the main branch:
  http://wiki.github.com/voldemort/voldemort/failure-detection
* Beta mechanism for restoring all of node's data from replicas on
  demand. This is an alternative to a more gradual mechanism provided
  by read-repair: useful when a machine is down for a prolonged period
  and is then re-inserted into the cluster.
  Invoked via JMX: the operation is restoreDataFromReplication in the
  voldemort.server.VoldemortServer MBean, with a mandatory parameter
  (integer >= 1) indicating the number of transfers to do in parallel.
* Simple gossip protocol (for cluster metadata) merged
  into the main branch. Disabled by default: use "enable.gossip=true"
  to enable, use "gossip.interval.ms" to set an interval at which gossip
  occurs (default: 30000 i.e., 30 seconds).
* Fixed issue 190: add a way of aggregating performance data over
  all stores
* Fixed issue 181: stack trackes shouldn't be filled for Obsolete
  version exception

Release 0.60.1 on 12/18/2009

Minor changes made since 0.60:

* Better logging in the exception thrown if config/.temp and
  config/.version are copied
* Bumping up the version to 0.60.1 in order to release updated
  archives, fixing an error in the stores.xml for single_node_cluster
  sample config

Release 0.60 on 12/15/2009

Changes made since 0.57.1:

* Admin Client/Server API: adds support for streaming-based transfer
  of entries between nodes, deleting entries on remote nodes,
  remotely deleting and updating metadata
* EC2 testing: a way to periodically run integration and performance
  tests which involve Voldemort instances on different machines
* Experimental support for views
* Interpolation search for read-only stores
* Support for large lists and strings in the JSON serializer
* LZF compression support
* Ruby client contributed
* Fixed issue 170: hanging if a port is used by another process
* Fixed issue 122: suspicious integer division in
  RequestCounter.getThroughput
* Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes for read-only stores
